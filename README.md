# 20th-Century
Project using Python to give a visualization of the interrelations between countries throughout the 20th century.

### Project Description:
It is believed that past events heavily influence the current geopolitical climate. We want to analyze data from world events in the 20th century to uncover relationships and dependencies between countries. To do this we will conduct data mining, conduct a network analysis, and create network visualizations.

### Data:
Text data scraped from the Wiki page "Key events of the 20th century": https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_events_of_the_20th_century
